'''
James Vann's Brain.

This is my first publicly avaible code, and I would appreciate any comments on my methods/style.

Ideas for Improvement:

1) Create a proxy class that would set between the calls to game functions, and cache certain things like radar requests.
This way, once a tile type has been determined, it does not have to be checked again- the proxy class caches the result.
This would give the brain a memory :)

2) Some of the logic could be turned into additional functions, making manteniance a bit easier.
