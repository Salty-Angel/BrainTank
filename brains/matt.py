Wander Brain

This is a sample wandering brain. It just drives until it
hits an obstacle then chooses a new direction. It also changes
direction periodically.

Variables available to brains:
    color - string, tank color
    position - tuple (x,y), current tank grid position
    facing - symbol UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, current tank facing
    direction - tuple (x,y), unit vector representing tank facing
    shots - how many shots have been fired
    tanks - list of other tanks in map
    tank_positions - [(x,y)] other tank positions
    tank_states - list of other tank states (see Tank States)

Functions available to brains:
    memory() - returns [symbol], a read only copy of queued commands
    forget() - clear all queued brain commands
    face(symbol) - change tank facing to symbol UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
    forward() - move tank forward one space
    backward() - move tank backward one space
    shoot() - fire tank's weapon with current facing
    radar(x,y) - get a tuple (tile, item) from the map's x,y coordinate
    kill() - self destruct tank

Facings:
    UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT,

Brain Commands:
    FORWARD, BACKWARD, SHOOT

Tank States:
    IDLE, MOVING, TURNING, SHOOTING, DEAD

Tiles:
    GRASS, DIRT, PLAIN, WATER
    SAFE_TILES = (GRASS, DIRT, PLAIN) - can be driven on safely
    UNSAFE_TILES = (WATER,) - will destroy your tank if you drive into them

Items:
    ROCK, TREE - blocking items that can be destroyed
    TANK_BLUE, TANK_RED - tanks located on a tile

Lookup Helper Dictionaries:
    FACING_TO_VEC - takes a facing symbol and returns the (x,y) unit vector
